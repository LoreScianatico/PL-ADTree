# PL-ADTree
This project consists in a Prolog implementation of th Alternating Decision Tree algorithm deisgned by Freund and Mason in their paper:
The Alternating Decision Tree Algorithm. Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 124-133 (1999). Also, it comes with simple datasets for testing program.

This program has been tested with SWI-Prolog. No other Prolog implementations are supported.
